# Luis Marrero – Personal Website

[![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/site-luismarrero.me-0f172a?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.luismarrero.me/)

This is my personal site built with [Astro](https://astro.build).  
I use it to experiment with ideas, explore creative tools, and connect my projects.

This site is based on a template created by [Kadir Lofca](https://github.com/kadirlofca), who deserves all the credit for the design and structure. I've adapted it for my experiments.

If you're looking for my resume and portfolio, visit [luismarrer.github.io/en](https://luismarrer.github.io/en/).
